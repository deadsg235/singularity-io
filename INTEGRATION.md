# Component Integration Plan for Singularity.io

This document details how the various components of Singularity.io (Frontend, Backend, Neural Network, Blockchain) will connect and interact with each other.

## 1. Frontend (Next.js) <> Backend (FastAPI)

*   **Communication Protocol:** RESTful API calls using HTTP/HTTPS.
*   **Data Format:** JSON.
*   **Endpoints:**
    *   Frontend will make requests to the FastAPI backend for data retrieval (e.g., blockchain status, user data, SolFunMeme insights) and for sending user actions (e.g., initiating transactions, interacting with smart contracts).
    *   The backend will expose well-defined API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/solana/transactions`, `/api/v1/nn/predict`, `/api/v1/solfunmeme/interact`).
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or similar token-based authentication for securing API calls, handled by the FastAPI backend.
*   **Error Handling:** Standard HTTP status codes and detailed JSON error responses.

## 2. Backend (FastAPI) <> Neural Network (Python-Rust Bridge)

*   **Communication Method:** Direct function calls. The FastAPI application will import the Python module generated by the Rust bridge (`pynnet_bridge`).
*   **Data Exchange:** Python native data types (e.g., lists, dictionaries, NumPy arrays) will be passed between Python and the Rust functions exposed via `pyo3`.
*   **Purpose:** FastAPI will call neural network functions (implemented in Rust for performance) for tasks such as:
    *   Predictive analytics related to Solana or SolFunMeme.
    *   Optimizing transaction parameters.
    *   Analyzing market trends.

## 3. Backend (FastAPI) <> Blockchain (Rust Solana Integration)

*   **Communication Method:** RPC (Remote Procedure Call) to a Solana node. The FastAPI backend will use a Solana client library (e.g., `solana.py`) to interact with the Solana blockchain.
*   **Key Operations:**
    *   Submitting transactions to the Solana network (e.g., token transfers, smart contract interactions).
    *   Querying blockchain state (e.g., account balances, program data).
    *   Listening for on-chain events.
*   **Smart Contract Interaction:** FastAPI will construct and sign transactions to call functions on the custom Solana programs developed in Rust (`solana_integration`).

## 4. Blockchain (Rust Solana Integration) <> SolFunMeme Technology

*   **Communication Method:** Directly within the Solana smart contracts. The core logic of SolFunMeme (as defined in `SOLFUNMEME.md`) will be implemented as part of the custom Rust Solana programs.
*   **Interaction:** SolFunMeme's problem-solving and economic mechanisms will be encoded in the smart contract logic, triggered by on-chain events or transactions.
*   **Data Storage:** On-chain data accounts managed by the Solana programs.

## 5. Deployment Considerations

*   **FastAPI Deployment:** Vercel (serverless functions) or a containerized environment (e.g., Docker on AWS, GCP, Azure).
*   **Next.js Deployment:** Vercel (static site generation with server-side rendering capabilities).
*   **Solana Programs:** Deployed to the Solana network.
*   **Neural Network:** The Rust compiled module will be part of the FastAPI deployment package.

This plan will evolve as the specific functionalities of SolFunMeme and the new economy are more precisely defined.
