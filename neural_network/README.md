# Neural Network (Python & Rust Bridge)

This directory contains the Python-based neural network models and the Rust bridge for high-performance computing in Singularity.io.

## Getting Started

1.  **Navigate to the neural_network directory:**
    ```bash
    cd neural_network
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies (create a `requirements.txt` later):**
    ```bash
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Build the Rust bridge (details to be added later):**
    ```bash
    # cargo build
    ```
4.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Structure

*   `main.py`: The main Python script for the neural network.
*   `src/bridge.rs`: The Rust code for the Python-Rust bridge.
